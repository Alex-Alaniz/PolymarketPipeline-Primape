Simple Test Script for Polymarket Pipeline

This script provides simple functions to test individual parts of the pipeline.
Run this script with different arguments to test different parts:

python simple_test_script.py reset - Reset database and clean slack
python simple_test_script.py fetch - Fetch and post markets to Slack
python simple_test_script.py approve - Add approval reactions to posted markets
python simple_test_script.py check - Check for approvals and process them
python simple_test_script.py deploy - Post approved markets for deployment
python simple_test_script.py deploy_approve - Add approval reactions to deployment posts
python simple_test_script.py deploy_check - Check deployment approvals and deploy
