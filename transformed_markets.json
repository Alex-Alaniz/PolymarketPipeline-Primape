Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nFor the purpose of this market's resolution, any detonation of a nuclear weapon anywhere on the planet Earth will be sufficient to trigger a \"Yes\" resolution. This includes offensive usages, nuclear tests, and accidental detonations.\n\nUse/launch of a nuclear weapon that fails to detonate, a fake weapon that never detonates, or a dirty bomb that distributes radioactive material by means of a conventional explosion are not sufficient to trigger a \"Yes\" resolution of this market. Only a successful nuclear detonation will result in a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\nThis market may resolve to \"Yes\" as soon as a nuclear detonation is confirmed by a preponderance of credible reporting.\n\nFor the purpose of this market's resolution, determination as to whether a detonation was nuclear will be made by a preponderance of credible reporting.",
