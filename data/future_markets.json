      "description": "If OpenSea has a live token by April 1st, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"Yes\". Otherwise, the market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nHaving a live token in this context can be defined as a deployed-to-mainnet, actively transferrable and/or tradable token that is in some way native to the OpenSea product or protocol, and substantiated by OpenSea via official website or social media channels. Empirically speaking, having a live token will be considered fulfilled if official project channels announce the introduction of the token and it is live on mainnet, and swappable and acquirable (i.e. via Uniswap). In the case of a token being announced but not yet transferrable or \u201clive\u201d, that will not satisfy market conditions. If the token is deployed to mainnet (in any form, including some sort of voucher), but is not transferrable, that will also not satisfy market conditions. In the case of ERC20 tokens, if the token is deployed, but there is no existing Uniswap pool for the token, it will be considered not \u201clive\u201d and thus will not satisfy market conditions. For clarity, this market is about fungible tokens, and not NFTs related to a platform.",
