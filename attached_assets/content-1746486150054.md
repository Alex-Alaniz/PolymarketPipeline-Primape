Interesting mismatch with bookies on Atletico right now... they are playing as if true odds were 3-4%. I think that's because of the favourite longshot bias, but interesting still.

That‚Äôs exactly how bookies make money, they give you BS odds and over the long term is almost guaranteed to win, not predicting the future.

I estimate that 3-4% is just a probability of Atletico to win all 7 matches (60-65% in 6 easy matches and 50% against Betis). And after that they need Barcelona to lose 8 points. It‚Äôs probably less than 50%, but schedule for barca is hard and this is definitely possible.

You should not bet more than 8% of what you have at any given time. And don't spend it on things, where the outcome is highly unclear (e.g. sports). Good bet with little profit: elections: if the first numbers are revealed, some things are almost 100% certain. then go and buy something for 96ct. It is not much but things will accumulate.
