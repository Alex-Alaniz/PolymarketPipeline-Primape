### Market Summary  ![sparkle](https://polymarket.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fperplexity%2Fsparkle.svg&w=96&q=75)Generate

Rules

This market will resolve to “Yes” if Erling Haaland is the top goalscorer for the 2024/2025 English Premier League season. Otherwise this market will resolve to “No”.

If multiple players tie for the most goals in the 2024/2025 English Premier League season, the market will resolve based on most assists, then most games played, and finally the player's last name alphabetically if ties persist.

The primary resolution source for this market will be official information from the English Premier League. However, a consensus of credible reporting may also be used.

Isak is very cheap. Newcastle's counterpress and his playing style means he could easily score a brace every week in 10 game minutes

Bet365 have Salah winning it at 56%. Even if it is a tie, Salah leads Haaland with 13 against 1. This is incredible value.

Man city is back on form. The lost about 10 games previously yet the gap between Salah and Halaand (the goal scoring machine) is just 1 goal. Next game Haaland will cover this

A tie is very unlikely in this market, in the event of 2 players scoring the same number of goals, the trophy is awarded to the player who got the most assists. If this is also a tie, it is based on which player scored the least penalties.

If multiple players tie for the most goals in the 2024/2025 English Premier League season, the market will resolve based on most assists, then most games played, and finally the player’s last name alphabetically if ties persist.
