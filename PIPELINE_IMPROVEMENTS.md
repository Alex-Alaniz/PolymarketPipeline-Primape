# Polymarket Pipeline Improvements

This document outlines the key improvements made to the pipeline workflow.

## Overview of Changes

1. **Increased Market Fetch Limit**
   - Increased from 100 to 200 markets per pipeline run
   - More markets processed in each run for improved efficiency

2. **Batch Categorization**
   - Replaced individual API calls with a single batch request
   - Faster categorization with reduced API costs
   - Added utilities in `utils/batch_categorizer.py`

3. **Enhanced Slack Formatting**
   - Added rich formatting with event banners and option images
   - Included category badges in deployment approval messages
   - Created dedicated formatter in `utils/deployment_formatter.py`

4. **Improved Workflow**
   - Added dedicated categorization step between approval stages
   - Implemented in `categorize_approved_markets.py`
   - Better separation of concerns and additional quality checks

5. **Testing Utilities**
   - Added `reset_database.py` for clean testing
   - Created `test_pipeline_changes.py` to verify changes
   - Ensured backwards compatibility with existing components

## Workflow Steps

The updated pipeline workflow follows these steps:

1. **Fetch**: Get markets from Polymarket API (up to 200)
2. **Filter**: Keep only active, unresolved markets
3. **Initial Post**: Post markets to Slack for manual review
4. **Approval Check**: Process approval/rejection reactions
5. **Categorization**: Categorize approved markets with batch processing
6. **Deployment Post**: Format and post for deployment approval with rich formatting
7. **Deployment Check**: Process deployment approval/rejection reactions
8. **Deploy**: Deploy approved markets to Apechain

## Testing the Pipeline

To test the full pipeline workflow:

1. Reset the database: `python reset_database.py --force`
2. Clean the Slack channel: `python clean_slack_channel.py`
3. Run the pipeline to fetch and post markets: `python pipeline.py`
4. Approve some markets in Slack (add ✅ reaction)
5. Run the pipeline again to categorize and post for deployment: `python pipeline.py`
6. Approve deployment in Slack (add ✅ reaction)
7. Run the pipeline again to process approvals: `python pipeline.py`

## Verification

Run the test script to verify the components are working correctly:
```
python test_pipeline_changes.py
```

This will test:
- Market fetch limit
- Batch categorization
- Slack message formatting with images
- Deployment formatter with category information
